# snuffelaar-roeper

Firmware for [Snuffelaar](https://revspace.nl/Snuffelaar) to push the sensor,
values to MQTT. Forked initially from the [Snuffelding](https://github.com/Juerd/Snuffelding)
repository by [Juerd](https://github.com/Juerd) however I lost the fork
metadata somewhere across repo moves.

Intended to be used with PlatformIO, which will automatically grab the necessary libraries.
Probably works with the Arduino IDE, but you'd have to install numerous libraries manually.

## Magic incantation

Personally I don't bother with the PlatformIO GUI at all. It's easier to just use it from
the command line:

```
pio run -t upload && pio device monitor
```

## Configuration

Snuffelding uses [ESP-WiFiSettings](https://github.com/Juerd/ESP-WiFiSettings) for
lots of customizable settings, including WiFi network credentials and MQTT topics. The first
time your Snuffelaar uses ESP-WiFiSettings, it will become an access point with a
configuration portal. After that, you can get the portal back by pressing the portal button.
Just connect to `esp-123abc` and go to http://192.168.4.1/. Hint: use a smartphone or tablet.

## OTA

ArduinoOTA is disabled by default. It can be enabled using the portal. Don't forget to edit
`platformio.ini` with your hostname and password.

## Name

The name *Snuffelaar* is based on the board name it means *sniffer*. The word
*roeper* means yeller.
